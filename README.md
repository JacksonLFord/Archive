# Archive

Archive is a discord bot build using Discord.js in Javascript.

The program's tokens and passwords were removed.

It acts as a backend to Discord's bot system.

Archive was a project I worked on to help some friends learn Javascript.

It provided commands that sent step by step instructions.

The instructions helped them get started.
