# Archive

Archive is a discord bot build using Discord.js in Javascript.

The program's tokens and passwords were removed.

It acts as a backend to Discord's bot system.

Archive was a project I worked on to help some friends learn Javascript.

It provided commands that sent step by step instructions.

The instructions helped them get started.

Note : For the files to be uploaded to Github, I had to remove `Npm_Modules`. 
From what I understand `Npm ci` will install all the depedencies previously installed.
